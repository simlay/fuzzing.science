Hey!
 I'm Chaithu ([@ant4g0nist](https://twitter.com/ant4g0nist)). I have been doing security research for past couple of years focused on iOS/macOS and improving myself in Fuzzing. Here, I am going to document my research related to Fuzzing iOS/macOS, Android and some low-level stuff that includes writing custom emulatiors.

Sources for tools I write are available here: https://github.com/ant4g0nist.

I'm open for any research work you'd like to do with me. :) You can reach me at [@ant4g0nist](https://twitter.com/ant4g0nist).
