Welcome!

I'm Chaithu (ant4g0nist). I have been doing security research for past couple of years focused mostly on fuzzing stuff. 
I work mostly on building fuzzing frameworks, for my research, focused mostly on macOS/iOS. 
Recently I started working on Android, low-level stuff, emulations and hypervisors.

Most of the source code is available at Github: https://github.com/ant4g0nist.
