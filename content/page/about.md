Welcome!

I'm Chaithu (ant4g0nist). I have been working for past couple of years focused mostly on remote targets. 
I love building fuzzing frameworks, and research, focused mostly on macOS/iOS. 
Recently I started working on Android, low-level stuff, emulations and hypervisors.

Most of the source code is available at Github: https://github.com/ant4g0nist.
