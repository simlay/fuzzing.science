Hey!
 I'm Chaithu ([@ant4g0nist](https://twitter.com/ant4g0nist)). Focused mostly on iOS/Android low-level security research for past couple of years. Here, I am going to document my research related to fuzzing, vulnerability research, iOS/macOS, Android and basebands that also include writing custom emulators. Recently started working on Smart Contract Security.

Source for tools I write are available here: https://github.com/ant4g0nist.

I'm open for any research work you'd like to do with me. You can reach me at [@ant4g0nist](https://twitter.com/ant4g0nist).
